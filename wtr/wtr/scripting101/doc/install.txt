h1. Scripting for Testers

h2. Installation Instructions

These instructions describe how to install the software we'll use in
our _Scripting for Testers_ class (aka _Scripting Web Tests_).

We will be using Ruby (a programming language) and WTR
(a library) on your machine to test server software. You can run the
server software on your computer. In some cases, we use a classroom
network so that you can access the same server software running on
your instructor's machine.

h3. Hardware Requirements

<B>The class software runs on Windows machines. We recommend Windows 2000
or Windows XP. You should have Administrator privileges.</B>

We believe that it will also work on Windows NT and Windows 98, but we
don't support these in our classes. (Our experience has been that
machines that are still running these operating systems often are too
slow or have other problems that we don't have time for in a class
environment. Sorry.)

The WTR software requires Internet Explorer and therefore only runs on 
Windows. The Timeclock server was developed on a
Macintosh, and should run on any machine supporting Ruby (Unix, Linux,
Windows). The Timeclock "product tests" will not run on Windows using
the mswin build (the one you use for the class). They will run on
Windows using the cygwin build.

h3. Installing the Software

h4. Ruby

We are currently using this Ruby installer: 
"ruby181-12.exe.":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&release_id=414 
(There are known problems with ruby 1.8.1-13; don't use it.)

#      Double-click this exe file to install.
#      Select the default installation options (choose all options;
       install in c:/ruby).  
#      If you are installing as Administrator you don't need to
       restart windows. Otherwise, you should.  

h4. IE Controller

You will need to install this Ruby library:
"iec.2004.227.0.zip":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&release_id=727    

#      Unzip this file onto your hard drive (c:). An "iec" directory
#      will be created automatically.
#      Start up a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter "cmd".)
#      Enter "cd iec".
#      Enter "ruby install.rb".

(You can also install this by just double-clicking the install.rb icon
in windows explorer. The problem with this method is that you won't
see any error messages.) 

h4. Scripting Class Materials.

You will also need the materials hosted on rubyforge.org:
"scripting101-1.3.1.tar.gz":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=104&release_id=717

# Extract the contents of this archive into your hard drive (c:). A
  "scripting101" directory will be created automatically.

h3. Running the Timeclock Server.

You probably won't need to do this for class, since you can use your
instructor's server. Otherwise, here is how to start up a timeclock
server on your machine. 

#      Start a command shell. (Start-> Run, enter "cmd".)
#      Enter "cd c:\scripting101\timeclock\bin".
#      Enter "ruby http-server.rb". The server is now running.

Note: If you close this command window, the server will stop.

You can verify that the server is running correctly by running some
sample tests.

#      Start a new command shell.
#      Enter "ruby c:\scripting101\solutions\suite.rb -b".

Note: These tests will run unbearably slowly if Internet Explorer is 
configured to use a proxy server that is unavailable.
